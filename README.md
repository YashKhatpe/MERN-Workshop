## 🚀 End of Day 1: What Should Be Achieved?

✅ **React**: Participants can build UI, use state, and fetch data.
✅ **Node.js**: They can create a basic http server and serve data.
✅ **Fetching data from json file**: The http server will fetch the data stored in the notes.json file at the backend.

Happy Coding! 🚀

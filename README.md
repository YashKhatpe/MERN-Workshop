# MERN-Workshop
A Personal Notes App built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and store notes in MongoDB via a RESTful API. This project demonstrates CRUD operations, API integration, and frontend-backend communication, making it ideal for learning full-stack development.
